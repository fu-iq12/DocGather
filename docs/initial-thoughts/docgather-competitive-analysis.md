# ♟️ DocGather Strategic Intelligence Report

**Competitive Analysis • Market Landscape • Strategic Verdict**

## 📋 Executive Summary

> [!NOTE]
> **Bottom Line Up Front**
> **Current Status:** High Market Saturation in General Storage.
> **Opportunity:** "French Administrative Complexity" creates a localized moat.
> **Pivot:** B2B2C model (Broker -> Client) is the winning strategy over direct B2C.

### Key Drivers

- **Red Ocean (General Space):** Owned by Google/Dropbox.
- **Blue Ocean (Localized B2B):** Localized B2B Automation for Mortgage/Real Estate.
- **Strategy:** Sell to the Broker/Agent, who invites the Client.

## 💡 Core Insights

1. **The "DossierFacile" Problem (France):**
   State-backed _DossierFacile_ is free and verified. Competing directly in B2C rentals is extremely difficult. DocGather must integrate with or surpass them via API for professionals.

2. **The "Email Chaos" Pain Point (B2B):**
   Brokers spend 30% of time chasing clients for "page 2 of the tax return". Global tools (FileInvite) are expensive ($50+/mo) and English-centric. Gap: A French-first, UX-perfect tool.

3. **Emerging "Client Portal" Trend:**
   Startups like _Portal_ or _Moxie_ combine file gathering with billing. DocGather should stay focused on "Compliance & Gathering" to avoid feature creep, but offer a "white label" experience.

## 🗺️ Competitive Landscape

**X-Axis:** Administrative Specialization (Compliance/Knowledge)
**Y-Axis:** Market Focus (B2C -> B2B)

| :------------------ | :----- | :---------- | :------- | :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DossierFacile**   | FR     | Gov/Startup | **High** | B2C/B2B        | State-backed, free service for rental dossiers. Verifies & watermarks docs. **Opinion:** The category killer for rentals. Don't fight them, integrate with them. |
| **FileInvite**      | Global | SaaS        | **High** | B2B            | Global leader in automated collection. **Opinion:** Great product but expensive and lacks French context. Their UX is the benchmark.                             |
| **Digiposte**       | FR     | Corporate   | **Med**  | B2C            | La Poste's digital safe. Connects to banks. **Opinion:** Passive storage. Users have it but don't "use" it for active procedures. Clunky UI.                     |
| **Content Snare**   | Global | SaaS        | **Low**  | B2B (Creative) | Focus on agencies gathering content. **Opinion:** Different niche (Creative vs Legal). Good inspiration for "client reminders" UX.                               |
| **Vialink**         | FR     | Enterprise  | **Med**  | Enterprise     | KYC automation for banks. **Opinion:** Too complex/expensive for small brokers. Leaves SMB market open for DocGather.                                            |
| **Dropbox / Drive** | Global | Giant       | **Low**  | General        | General purpose storage. **Opinion:** The default alternative. But "sharing a folder" is not "managing a procedure".                                             |
| **Zelok**           | FR     | Niche       | **Med**  | B2B (PropTech) | Specialized in rental management. **Opinion:** Strong in real estate niche. Example of successful verticalization.                                               |

## 📐 Strategic Simulator (B2B vs B2C)

_Based on simulation model comparing direct user subscription vs broker licensing._

| Metric      | B2C Reality                                               | B2B Reality                                               |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Churn**   | **High (>30%)**. Users leave after the procedure is done. | **Low (<5%)**. Consistent tool for professional workflow. |
| **CAC**     | Hard to recoup. Needs massive volume.                     | Higher upfront, but paid back by LTV.                     |
| **Revenue** | Unstable, transactional.                                  | Sticky, compounding.                                      |
| **Verdict** | ❌ **High Risk**                                          | ✅ **Sustainable**                                        |

> [!TIP]
> **B2B Advantage:** A broker uses it for _every_ client. The cost is passed on or absorbed as "efficiency".

## ♟️ Strategic Verdict

### Go B2B (The "Broker" Strategy)

Position DocGather as the "Assistant" for professionals who handle paperwork.
**Target Personas:**

- **Courtier en prêt (Mortgage Brokers):** High volume, urgent deadlines.
- **Agence Immobilière (Real Estate):** Rental applications are chaotic.
- **Experts-Comptables (Accountants):** Monthly document chase.
- **Notaires (Notaries):** Extreme compliance needs.

### The "French" Advantage

US competitors build for "Forms". You build for "Procedures".
**Killer Features:**

- **OCR Verification:** Auto-flag expired/fake documents (Avis d'Imposition).
- **Procedure Templates:** One-click "Rental Pack" or "Loan Pack".
- **France Connect:** Fetch docs directly via API (huge trust factor).
- **RGPD Data Room:** Auto-delete files after legal retention period.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- **Phase 1: Focus (Niche B2B Penetration)**
  Target ONE vertical (e.g., Mortgage Brokers in France). Perfect the "invite client -> collect docs -> verify" loop.
- **Phase 2: Expand (European Compliance)**
  Adapt for Germany (Schufa, etc.) and UK. Add ID Verification (API integration) to increase ARPU.
- **Phase 3: Platform (The "Wallet" Play)**
  Once millions of clients have used DocGather via brokers, convert them to a personal "Life Admin" wallet app (B2B2C).
